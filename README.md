# Project-One-Two-
1. Analysis of the run-time and memory for the data structures.
* Vectorâ€™s elements are stored contiguously. Element can be accessed through iteration and pointer to elements. Vector usually take ore space because the memory is allocated to handle future growth. (cppreference)
* Hash tables provide constant-time O(1) lookup on average, regardless of the number of items in the table. Worst-case lookup time in most hash table schemes is O(n). Compared to other associative array data structures, hash tables are most useful when we need to store a large numbers of data records. ((2021) CISP 430)
* In a binary tree, a node can have maximum two children, one known as left and right child. Binary tree main operations are search, insert and delete. All operations are work in O(Logn) time  

2. The working code that will sort and print out a list of the courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order.
* Code is in the Alphanumeric Order Code file

# Reflection 
1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
* In this project, I was having problem with inserting the data into the Binary tree after coding the BST structure and insert function. 
3. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
* I used Module 5, BST assignment code as my reference and approached to SNHU tutor for explanation.  
5. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
* For the activites, I did many researches by using stackoverflow.com, geekforgeek.com, Cplusplus.com, review notes from ZY BOOK and the youtube video that was recommanded by the Professor. 
* For the projects, I used the code from the previous assignments as reference, and approached to the tutuor for detail explanation.  
7. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
* 
9. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
