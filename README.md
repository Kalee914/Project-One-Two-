# Project-One-Two-
1. Analysis of the run-time and memory for the data structures.
* Vectorâ€™s elements are stored contiguously. Element can be accessed through iteration and pointer to elements. Vector usually take ore space because the memory is allocated to handle future growth. (cppreference)
* Hash tables provide constant-time O(1) lookup on average, regardless of the number of items in the table. Worst-case lookup time in most hash table schemes is O(n). Compared to other associative array data structures, hash tables are most useful when we need to store a large numbers of data records. ((2021) CISP 430)
* In a binary tree, a node can have maximum two children, one known as left and right child. Binary tree main operations are search, insert and delete. All operations are work in O(Logn) time  

3. The working code that will sort and print out a list of the courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order.
